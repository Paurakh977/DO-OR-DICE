Staying alive always matters.

## ☠️ What Happens When You Are Eliminated?

If your HP reaches **0 or below**:

❌ You are **not removed** from the game.

Instead, you become a **Fallen Player**.

This means:

* You cannot win the game
* You do not have HP anymore
* **You still roll the dice every round**

---

## 👻 Dice Rules for Fallen Players

Fallen Players roll once per round and apply the effect below:

| Dice Roll | Shadow Effect                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2       | Nothing happens                                     |
| 3–4       | Give **+2 HP** OR **+1 VP** to any alive player     |
| 5–6       | Remove **−2 HP** OR **−1 VP** from any alive player |

### Important Rule

* You **cannot affect the same player two rounds in a row**

This keeps the game fair and fun.

---

## ⭐ Victory Points (VP)

You earn VP by:

* Rolling **3 or 6**
* Surviving a round (+1 VP)
* Eliminating another player (**+2 VP**)

VP decides the final ranking.

---

## 🏁 Ending the Game

The game ends when:

* Only **1 player remains alive**, OR
* **12 rounds** are finished

Then all players (alive and fallen) are ranked.

---

## 🥇 How Top 3 Is Decided

Players are ranked using these rules (in order):

1. **Highest Victory Points (VP)**
2. If tied → Higher HP at the time of elimination
3. If still tied → Fewer rounds spent as Fallen Player
4. Still tied? → One final dice roll

This always gives a clear **Top 3**.

---
